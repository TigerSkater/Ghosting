 Squash Ghosting Drill

This is a simple, customizable web app designed to support squash ghosting drills.

During each drill, the app:
	•	Randomly selects a direction (Front Left, Front Right, Side Left, Side Right, Back Left, Back Right)
	•	Displays an image representing that direction
	•	Uses audio prompts — both voice synthesis and optional recorded voice memos
	•	Includes adjustable timers for drill pacing and rest
	•	Is mobile-friendly, designed especially for iPad use on court

Voice Accessibility:
Yes — it reads aloud the directions and motivational messages using speech synthesis or human voice recordings. Ideal for vision-limited athletes or hands-free training.

Inspiration

The idea for this app came from a ghosting drill tool used by my coach, Coach Faheem, which was originally developed with help from one of his friends.
This is a reimagined version — lighter, mobile-friendly, and voice-integrated — built with love and a lot of squash sweat.
